The lectures notes or activities are written using the [Jupyter IPython Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), part of the [Python ecosystem for scientific computing]( http://scipy.org/ ). You can view these lectures in different ways: simply read on line by clicking on the links below; or download a single notebook or all the stuff or yet fork this entire repository using the GitHub resources and run the notebooks in your computer or in the cloud by clicking on the Open in Colab button. I hope this material is useful to you and I am open to suggestions or comments.\n",
